# alt_bitfields
If you need to create a lot of many-many-many bitfields in an intuitive way, check out some of these macro.

Note that it IS NOT a clone of "rust bitfiels" crate. It is though my own alternative view of how bitfields in rust must be and I believe that in some cases it's more apropriate and easier to use (and understand). Or maybe I just didn't pay much effort to learn the original bitfields whatsoever :)
